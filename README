Qiuck and Dirty PHP manual for Vim (outdated, should be updated)

features:
- manual in text form
- tag file for help text file for
  * auto completion (eg c-n) which is a lot faster than the php completion
    shipping with Vim, but has no argument info
  * function and thing lookup using tags. Eg try :tjump array_diff<cr>


== How to update it: ==
I did the dump using elinks or such

how to update it:
1) get single html file: http://www.php.net/download-docs.php
2) links -dump the-html-file > manual/allinonemod.txt
3) apply a pattern like this:
    %s@^\s\+-\{10,}\n\n\s\+-\{10,}\n\n \{10,50}\(\S*\)@==================================\nthing: \1@g
3) cd manual; makeTags.sh


alternatives
=============
irc DanielConvissor: "pman" for use on the command line: "pear install doc.php.net/pman"
