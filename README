Qiuck and Dirty PHP manual for Vim (outdated, should be updated)

features:
- manual in text form
- tag file for help text file for
  * auto completion (eg c-n) which is a lot faster than the php completion
    shipping with Vim, but has no argument info
  * function and thing lookup using tags. Eg try :tjump array_diff<cr>


== How to update it: ==
I did the dump using elinks or such

how to update it:
1) get single html file: http://www.php.net/download-docs.php
2) links -dump the-html-file > manual/allinonemod.txt
3) apply a pattern like this:
    %s@^\s\+-\{10,}\n\n\s\+-\{10,}\n\n \{10,50}\(\S*\)@==================================\nthing: \1@g
3) cd manual; makeTags.sh


alternatives
=============
irc:
< DanielConvissor> "pman" for use on the command line: "pear install doc.php.net/pman"
< DanielConvissor> MarcWeber: fyi, the PhD package has a token/function list generator which you may be able to use for generating 
your package.  or you could even build an extension class to PhD that builds
your package for you and/or your users.

Does somebody want to work on it?
